# S7: Wallets and Transactions on the Blockchain

# Notes on the Upcoming Cryptocurrency Implementation

Excellent work on completing the blockchain side of the project. Already, you have a pretty powerful storage system that is decentralized and distributed across connected nodes in a network.

Next, we’ll implement the objects that will construct the cryptocurrency of the project. We’ll build off of the blockchain concepts and ideas. Still, there will be a handful of new engineering concepts in the upcoming additions. The key is to stay focused on the general concepts that appear in the presentations. Remembering how objects interact with each other, and their purpose, will help detailed code stay more clear.

With that in mind, get excited, because you’ll now enter the cryptocurrency half of the project!
